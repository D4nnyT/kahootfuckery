mrparser.py:
[ ] Client: needs to handle payloads
	- Forward request first, and then forward every time we see payload, won't break on large files
[ ] Client: What if client does not send content-length but still posts?
[ ] Server: Implement buffer
[ ] Server: Forward headers with no payloads
[ ] Server: Forward payloads - same as client way of doing it
